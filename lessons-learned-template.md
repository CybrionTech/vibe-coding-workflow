## Writing Effective Lessons

### Be Specific
❌ "Testing was good"
âœ… "Automated UAT caught 4 frontend integration issues before user testing, saving 2 hours of troubleshooting"

### Include Context
❌ "Don't use approach X"
âœ… "Approach X failed because Y. Use approach Z instead, which handles edge case A and B"

### Quantify Impact
❌ "Improved performance"
âœ… "Response time reduced from 800ms to 250ms (69% improvement) by implementing caching"

### Provide Actionable Recommendations
❌ "Communication needs improvement"
âœ… "Add daily standup notes in docs/coordination/ to keep agents synchronized on blockers"

---

## Updating Frequency

**When to update:**
- After each version completion (mandatory)
- During troubleshooting if significant insight discovered
- When patterns emerge across multiple versions

**Version update timing:**
- Update lessons-learned.md when version marked complete
- Commit alongside Status Report

---

## Example Lesson Entry

```markdown
### v0.5 – Live Market Data Feed

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Status:** Complete

#### What Worked âœ…

- **WebSocket Infrastructure (95% confidence):** Connection stability validated through 30-minute stress test
  - Zero unexpected disconnections
  - Sub-second reconnection after simulated failures
  - Proper state synchronization across frontend/backend
  - **Why it worked:** Early architectural validation with ChatGPT caught potential race conditions

#### What Could Be Improved ðŸ"„

- **Market Hours Dependency (External constraint):** Live data validation requires specific time windows
  - Impact: 66% of DoD items untestable during after-hours development
  - Root cause: Cannot simulate live market conditions accurately
  - **Recommendation:** Schedule validation sessions during market hours (9:30-10:30 AM ET) for critical features

#### Recommendations ðŸ"‹

- Add market hours awareness to UAT playbooks (flag time-dependent tests)
- Build data replay capability for after-hours testing
- Document external constraints upfront in Mission Orders
```

## Using Lessons Learned

**Before starting new version:**
1. Review lessons from previous version
2. Check action items - incorporate into new Mission Order
3. Identify patterns - adjust approach proactively

**During development:**
1. Reference lessons when making similar decisions
2. Add new insights as they emerge
3. Track whether recommended changes are working

**After version complete:**
1. Document what worked/didn't work
2. Quantify improvements (metrics)
3. Create action items for next version
