# Quick Start Guide

## Status

**⚠️ Coming in Future Version**

This guide will walk you through building a complete tiny project (todo list app) in 2-3 hours to internalize the workflow before tackling real projects.

---

## Planned Content

### Learning Objectives
By completing this quick start, you will:
- Understand the complete workflow end-to-end
- Create your first PRD and roadmap
- Execute one complete version (v0.1)
- Run automated and user UAT
- Generate a status report
- Experience all approval gates

### The Tutorial Project: Simple Todo List

**Why a todo list?**
- Small enough to complete in hours, not weeks
- Touches all workflow phases
- Demonstrates frontend + backend patterns
- Simple enough to focus on workflow, not domain complexity

**What you'll build:**
- v0.1: Basic CRUD (create/read/update/delete) todos
- Single version to v1.0 (no multi-version complexity)
- Local-only (no deployment complexity)
- Demonstrates core workflow patterns

### Tutorial Structure (Planned)

**Part 1: Setup (15 minutes)**
- Install required tools
- Create project directory
- Initialize git

**Part 2: Product Definition (45 minutes)**
- Create simplified PRD for todo app
- Create single-version roadmap
- Review relevant production standards

**Part 3: Version Execution (60 minutes)**
- Create mission order for v0.1
- Pass to Claude Code
- Watch Zen Plan creation
- Monitor implementation
- Run automated UAT

**Part 4: Validation & Completion (30 minutes)**
- Execute user UAT
- Review status report
- Mark version complete
- Reflect on learning

### Key Takeaways (Planned)
- You make decisions, AI implements
- Approval gates prevent expensive rework
- Clear DoD items make success measurable
- Production standards inform architecture
- The workflow scales from tiny to complex projects

## Current Workaround

**Before this guide exists:**

1. Start by reading `workflow-overview.md` completely
2. Review `prd-template.md` to understand product definition
3. Look at `mission-order-standard.md` to see what execution looks like
4. Consider starting with a very small real project (1-2 versions max)

**Recommended First Project Characteristics:**
- Personal use (low stakes)
- 1-3 versions maximum
- Familiar domain (you understand the problem)
- CLI or simple web app (avoid complex UX)
- No external integrations (keep it self-contained)

## Tutorial Features (When Complete)

The full quick start guide will include:
- Complete worked example files (PRD, roadmap, mission order)
- Actual ChatGPT conversation transcripts
- Screenshots of key workflow steps
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- "What just happened?" explanations after each phase
- Troubleshooting for common first-timer issues

**Note:** This guide will be created based on real user onboarding experiences.
